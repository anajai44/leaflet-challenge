The data utlized was obtained from`http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php`, and then utilized the data `Past 7 Days1`: `All Earthquakes`. The data was loaded and I created an Earthquake Visualization that was a map that marks where Earthquakes have occured during the last 7 days. 

## Help
It has been a while since I learned about this concept. I reached out to Chatgpd and help from previous class activities to better understand the concept.
